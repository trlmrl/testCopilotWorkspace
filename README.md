## Personal Page

This repository contains a personal page for a fictional person named John Doe. The personal page includes a header, a brief introduction, and contact information.

### Viewing the Personal Page

To view the personal page, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Clock Functionality

The personal page now includes an analog clock that displays the current time. The clock is updated every second.

To view the clock, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The clock will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

### Bootstrap Integration

The personal page now uses Bootstrap for styling and layout. Bootstrap's grid system is used to create a responsive layout, and various Bootstrap classes are applied to improve the appearance of the header, sections, contact information list, and clock canvas.
